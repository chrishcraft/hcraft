Hi, I'm Chris Skomorowski, owner of Home Craft. My professional background began at Conestoga College in Kitchener, Ontario where I completed the Architecture Construction Engineering and Technology program. Being a jack of all trades, I quickly found a passion for home design as it allows me to be involved in every aspect of the process, starting with the creative and artistic design phase through to the problem solving technical side of producing construction drawings.

I started working with home builders in their drafting departments, producing plans for simple suburban homes to custom one off builds. Eventually I sought more variety, and Home Craft was born as an avenue to pursue work beyond the suburbs, providing the opportunity to work directly with home owners and builders on projects that go above and beyond minimum code requirements. I prefer working on modern, minimalist designs, and utilizing high performance building techniques taken from experience working with Passive House and Net Zero projects.

When I'm not working on your dream home, I can often be found outdoors spending my time in the mountains finding rock to climb up in the summer, or alternatively in the winter, sliding down them sideways on a snowboard. If I'm not on epic adventures, I keep the body and mind busy with squash, tennis, running, photography, wood working, and card or board games. I'm a bit of a beverage snob when it comes to coffee, whiskey and beer, and I am a vegetarian that spends too much time cooking with a cast iron skillet. I appreciate attention to detail and the little things in life, something I carry over to my designs and drawings.

If you have any questions about your project, pricing, or just to find out more about Home Craft and if I'm the right person for the job, please get in touch.
