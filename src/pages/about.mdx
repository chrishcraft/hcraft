# Services

Home Craft is a custom home design and drafting firm based in Kelowna, BC, offering services throughout the Okanagan. We focus on contemporary style homes where your needs and desires are combined with a function forward design principle, driven by the understanding that homes are meant to be lived in, and not just to look good on a marketing brochure or Pinterest photo. By utilizing high performance building science and Passive House principles our designs are thoughtfully detailed to energy efficient and environmentally friendly as possible within the scope of the project. We can also design for alternative construction methods, such as Hempcrete, rammed earth, etc.

All of our work is in full 3D and we can provide detailed renderings for marketing purposes, as well as virtual reality walk through tours that fully convey the design intent and help eliminate any possible complications on site by seeing the final product before ground is broken.

Our work is primarily new home design, carriage homes, additions, and renovations. Whether it's smaller interior job removing bearing walls, a significant rear or upper floor addition, or completely new home design, we're able to produce highly detailed drawing packages that go above and beyond the bare minimum. The process typically resembles:

- Initial consultation scope of project meeting
- Design questionnaire
- Site measure up and creation of existing condition drawings (if required)
- Preliminary design proposal
- Finalize design through revisions based on client feedback
- Development permit package (if required)
- Draft permit package for client review
- Final permit drawing package and application

We're also available during construction for further consultation throughout the duration of the project.
