![Newport Front at Dusk](Image01.jpg "Newport Front at Dusk")

The Newport is a contemporary home design for [Align West Homes](https://www.alignwesthomes.com/) This thoroughly modern plan gets outside of the box with clever angles that break up the modern massing and adds some interest in the way it's oriented towards the street. The angled theme is continued along the rear with a large covered outdoor living area. 

The interior is generously spacious with the kitchen open to a two storey living area, three bedrooms upstairs with an office or optional fourth bedroom on the main floor, and the potential for a finished basement.  

This model is currently available to be built at [The Orchard](https://theorchardkelowna.com/) in The Mission. Contact us for more information!
