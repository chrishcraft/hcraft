![Olive Grove](Olive-Grove01.jpg "Olive Grove")

The Olive Grove is a prairie farmhouse inspired new design for [Align West Homes](https://www.alignwesthomes.com/) Subtle detailing and balanced form really make the exterior standout, this model is the perfect counterpart to the more contemporary offerings they offer.

An open concept lower level focused towards the rear of the house with a wide patio door allowing the living space to continue right into the backyard with a covered patio running the entire width of the house. Three bedrooms upstairs and a second family room flex space make this the perfect home for a growing family! Depending on the lot, an optional basement can further expand living space and storage to suit your needs. 

This model is currently available to be built at [The Orchard](https://theorchardkelowna.com/) in The Mission. Contact us for more information!
