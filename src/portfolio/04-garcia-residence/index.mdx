The Garcia Residence is a large, rural bungalow located on a large property outside of Cambridge, ON. The grade where the house is situated was elevated with fill to bring the top of the foundation more in line with the view from the road, and provide a commanding view of the surrounding property.

Inside, the wide open country feel is continued inside with an open concept plan and high vaulted ceilings in the living area and bedrooms. Private bedroom space is carefully separated from common areas of the house, something that's often overlooked in bungalow design. Special attention was also given to allow barrier free circulation within the house to accommodate potential future needs of their child who has autism. A triple bay garage provides a home for all the toys, and provides secondary access to the basement.

A detached workshop is currently under construction and will feature additional storage for quads, sleds, and tools, an storage loft above.
