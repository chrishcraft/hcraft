Designing a suburban home for a builder to use as a model comes with many challenges; maximizing the liveable square footage on the lot footprint, creating an interesting elevation with economical materials, striking the balance between aesthetically pleasing enough to sell but functional enough to live with, and creating a mass market appeal design that won't exclude any potential buyers. The Mapleridge model was the answer to overcoming those hurdles.

The open concept main floor is home to the galley style kitchen, living room, and dining room. Behind the central located stair is a generously sized laundry room with garage access. The second floor contains three to five bedrooms depending on it's configuration, with options for a large dressing room, open concept office space, and a luxury ensuite if the purchaser desires. A third floor loft option was included to utilize space in the attic, and can include a wet bar and balcony area off the rear. The basement is unfinished, but care has been taken to minimize structural and mechanical interference with the space to maximize it's future potential. The front elevation uses symmetry and subtle relief in the building face to create interest, as different material choice and changing the proportions of the building mass were not an option.
