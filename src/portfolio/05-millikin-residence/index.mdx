Take a look at our [teaser video render](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivhSdB9ddMs) for the Millikin Residence.

The site for this project was a challenging rock outcropping in the Regional District of Central Okanagan overlooking the lake and Kelowna. The client wanted a rustic design that suited the surrounding natural land, but with a modern influence. The result is a tasteful hybrid of prairie farmhouse combined with Scandinavian modern. While real wood barn board cladding was favoured suring conceptual design, RDCO requirements for the area dictated non-combustible cladding. Cement fiber board and batten with accents of wood textured metal siding and stone provide the rustic touches.

A spacious open main floor living space with ceilings vaulted to 14'-0" at the highest point provides the hub for daily life. A large three panel lift and slide door opens up to a covered patio to bring the outside into the living and dining space while providing expansive views of the lake and valley. Two equally sized bedrooms and a main bath are located on the main floor as well. Upstairs is the master suite isolated from the rest of the house and complete with it's own private den with views of Cedar Mountain and large private deck capturing panoramic valley views.

The site requires substantial blasting and grading to create a suitable building platform. Home Craft was retained as the project coordinator to look after the necessary civil engineering, environmental protection, and other scopes of work required for a successful development permit application. Enough space has been provided for a substantial future addition, allowing this phase to become the guest wing of the final residence.

Construction starts this Spring, check back for updates!
