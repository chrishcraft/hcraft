![SCD Model Front](SCD-Model01.jpg "SCD Model Front")

This beautiful new model for [Saunders Design Group](https://saundersdesigngroup.ca/) is available for construction! In this walkout design modern luxury meets flexibility with a one bedroom suite with private entrance located above the garage. Whether it's for rental income, a guest suite, or a for a stay at home college student, the extra functionality is a great perk.

The garage and suite connect to the main house with a breezeway and create a small courtyard for the main entrance. Not just a classy touch, the courtyard helps provide a buffer to the suite and breaks up the massing of what's actually quite a large home.

A two storey entrance beside a beautiful and unique floating staircase with oversized landings create a dramatic entry and lead the way into the rest of the way into a spacious open floor plan. Complete with a home office, theater, games room, bar, and even a flex space for a gym this luxurious model packs in a lot of amenities. Three generous sized bedrooms upstairs provide privacy for familiy members and a fourth bedroom in the lower walkout level for guests.
