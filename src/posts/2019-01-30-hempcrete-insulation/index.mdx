With legalized recreational cannabis having only been with us for a few months it seems fitting to take some time and discuss a construction use for hemp, a less psychoactive cannabis sativa cultivar that’s been legal to produce in Canada since 1998. You might have a shirt made of it, it might be a bio-plastic part in your car, you may have had its seeds on a salad or in a smoothie, but it turns out hemp is also an excellent insulation product. It has been much more common in Europe, with homes utilizing hempcrete insulation appearing in France during the mid 1980’s. The adoption in North America has been slower largely due to the lack of raw material as it’s still illegal to produce in most of the US, and the stigma it has by association with its THC focused cousin.

## What is Hempcrete?

Hemp hurd is broken up pieces of the woody stalk of the hemp plant, separated from the fiber. When combined with lime and water acting as a binder it creates a thick concrete like material that can be formed into the insulation for above grade walls and ceiling assemblies. While it may be a relatively new use for the materials, the primary components of hemp and lime have been used in various ways for thousands of years.

## The Home Craft Hempcrete Wall Assembly

Our proposed wall assembly is single stud wall with 12” of slip formed hempcrete:

- Exterior finish (shown with cement fiber board and batten)
- 1x3 strapping affixed to stud with min. 4” screws
- 12” hempcrete insulation
- 2x4 stud @ 24” O.C., centered on foundation wall
- Exposed hempcrete or plaster interior finish

The mechanical fastening of 1x3 strapping through the hempcrete to the stud allows for any typical exterior finish to be a viable option, and stucco can be direct applied to the hempcrete. Having the stud wall inset from the edge of the foundation eliminates thermal breaks through floor joist framing by allowing a continuous layer of hempcrete beyond the framing. This also reduces the temperature extremes that the structural framing is subjected to.

Interior finishing can be as simple as leaving the exposed hempcrete. With its tamped layers and warm colour it’s appearance is vaguely reminiscent of rammed earth and can be a feature wall. Alternatively, a traditional plaster render can be applied for a smoother finish. Thoughtful design can minimize the placement of electrical and mechanical through the exterior wall, but where required this can be accomplished either by casting conduit directly in the hempcrete, or strapping the interior with 2x4 and creating a mechanical chase. A 2x4 nailing board is embedded into the first lift of hempcrete to facilitate fastening of baseboard trim.

The foundation wall is insulated with 3” of rigid mineral wool insulation which combined with a 9” concrete foundation equals the depth of the hempcrete above and eliminates any thermal breaks at the floor assembly. The rigid mineral wool has adequate compressive strength to support the first lift of hempcrete as it cures.

The floor slab sits on rigid mineral wool insulation as well and uses a polyethylene sheet as a vapour barrier. While this is the only plastic product used in the entire assembly it’s a requirement for both vapour control and soil gas (radon) mitigation.

## Why use it? - Environment

As we strive towards higher energy savings utilizing higher insulation values and tighter building envelopes there is also a movement towards utilizing more environmentally friendly products. The blowing agents used in foam insulation, non-biodegradable plastics in construction waste, and energy intensive production of metal and concrete means that even though homes are more efficient than ever, it’s at the cost of a larger ecological footprint.

Alternative construction methods utilizing natural materials look to remedy those problems while still providing a high performance building. Hemp grows exceptionally fast and involves the use of little to no pesticides. The production of the hurd has a very low carbon footprint, and the lime binder actually re-absorbs carbon dioxide during the curing process resulting in a carbon negative material. It’s non-toxic with no off gassing and does not contribute to indoor air quality problems. Leftover material can be used on the builders next project, and cured hempcrete can even be broken apart and mixed into new hempcrete at the end of a buildings life cycle.

Hemp hurd itself is an agricultural byproduct. Whether the hemp was grown for its seed or fiber, neither type of production considers the hurd as a primary use. The hurds are typically used as economical animal bedding, with currently only a small portion being diverted for construction use.

## Why use it? - Other Benefits

Hempcrete has an exceptional moisture resistance and ability to handle swings in humidity. The porous structure of the plant fiber stores moisture through adsorption and absorption, up to 93% humidity without being overwhelmed. The lime binder holding the hurd together has a high PH and is naturally antifungal and antimicrobial preventing that. Its ability to handle moisture allows for some unique hygrothermal properties that translate into much higher thermal performance than it’s modest R-value would suggest.

When slip formed on site the material fills in every cavity around structural framing, which combined with it’s density allows for extremely effective control of airflow. A hempcrete and framed wall is usually capable of achieving the strict Passivhaus standards for air changes without any additional air or vapour barriers.

While hempcrete itself is not a structural material, it does offer an increase in strength to the wall assembly. This allows framing to be reduced, often to a code minimum of 2x4 at 24” on center, while preventing any deflection in the top plate as well as providing shear resistance.

The material is also inherently fire resistant. The lime binder provides a mineral coating around the hurd adding a high degree of flame resistance. There are plenty of videos on YouTube showing people holding torches to hempcrete walls, and a CAN/ULC test has quantified that with a 68 minute rating. With the increasing frequency and severity of forest fires throughout the Okanagan and BC this can offer peace of mind knowing that both the cladding and insulation surrounding the structure are effectively non-combustible.

## Anything bad about it?

There is no perfect insulation or building material, and hempcrete is not without its limitations. The weight of the material restricts some flexibility with above grade floors and extra engineering needs to be considered where walls do not align below, or use alternate assemblies in those areas.

Cost is always a factor in the decision process. While the hemp hurd is relatively inexpensive, it’s still a niche product without widespread distribution in place. It may be difficult to source or ship the raw material required. The lime binder uses specific combinations of both hydrated and hydraulic lime, the latter of which isn’t produced in North America. There are various clay and cement alternatives available as long as care is taken to ensure the binder has sufficient short term working strength for the hydrated lime to set. Third party premixed binders exist, but are from Europe where hempcrete is more widespread and could be cost prohibitive to source in North America.

The building science mechanisms that hempcrete uses to be part of an effective wall assembly differ from that of conventional assemblies. The building code is modeled around these conventional assemblies, and hempcrete does not utilize required air and vapour barriers that are typically required. Since there’s no provision for hempcrete in the code, alternative compliance measures require a building envelope consultant to verify that the science checks out before a permit will be issued.

Despite these hurdles hempcrete is still a viable alternative for construction in BC and Canada. As production of hemp increases with ever relaxing laws in the US, and possibly even as a waste stream byproduct of a growing recreational cannabis industry in Canada, access to the raw material will become easier and cheaper. With increased demand hopefully the building code will adopt provisions for hempcrete homes, eliminating an extra step in the permitting process.

If you’re interested in exploring hempcrete as an option in your upcoming project Home Craft would love to hear from you! We anticipate questions that may arise during construction and provide supporting details in our comprehensive drawing package, and will work with any enthusiastic contractor throughout the project to ensure its success.

A big thanks to HempWorks Canada for helping out with this post. We had an informative meeting where a number of conceptual details and hybrid wall systems were discussed before I concluded that the assembly I've outlined in this article is a viable approach. Better still they're local to the Okanagan and would be excited to work on any upcoming hempcrete project in the region. Give them a visit at [www.hemp-works.ca](www.hemp-works.ca)!
