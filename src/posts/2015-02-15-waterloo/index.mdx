Hemp hurd is broken up pieces of the woody stalk of the hemp plant, separated from the fiber. When combined with lime and water acting as a binder it creates a thick concrete like material that can be formed into the insulation for above grade walls and ceiling assemblies. While it may be a relatively new use for the materials, the primary components of hemp and lime have been used in various ways for thousands of years.
