In April 2012, the City of Waterloo implemented [by-law 2011-047](http://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/residentialrentallicences.asp) requiring all low rise rental houses to be licensed. The purpose of the by-law is to ensure that rentals are safe and habitable, particularly when it comes to student rentals. According to the by-law, one of the requirements of the license application is a set of floor plans that identifies:

i) all rooms, spaces or common areas;

ii) how each room, space or common area shall be used, which means specifically indicating where all Bedrooms will be located on the floor plan; and,

iii) the dimensions (in square meters) of all rooms, spaces or common areas.
