Are you looking for residential design and drafting services for your upcoming addition, renovation, or new build? After a brief hiatus Home Craft is back in action and operating in the Okanagan! We're currently looking for exciting new residential projects to help build our local client base and get our name out there.

**"That's great ... for you! What's in it for me?"**

Understanding the trepidation one might have in choosing a new firm, there are some incentives to consider:

- Reasonable pricing. I'm not looking to make a fortune on my first projects, I'm more interested in investing in my future by building a satisfied client base.
- Portfolio quality work. I want to combine your desires and expectations with my expertise to produce a methodically thought out design that you'll be proud to call home. The intent to showcase your project and use it to build the foundation for my company means I'm invested in the success of your project and want to make it my finest work.
- Above and beyond service. Extra meetings, thought out constructive criticisms, design studies and exploring all options that come to light. I'm won't happy with your design unless we both are.

**"I'm interested, now what?"**

Get in touch! I would be happy to set up a free consultation to discuss your project further, show you some of my current work, and find out if we would be a good match.
