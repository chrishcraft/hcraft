# Misc. usage notes

## Images on about page

You can only use images in the current directory for portfolio and posts. For other pages like "About" you need to place your images in the pre-existing `images` directory and refer to them by that path eg. `../images/someimg.jpg`.

## Portfolio slider

To show a slider at the top of a portfolio entry, make a directory of images under that portfolio item called `slider` and they will appear in lexical order.
